Bubble sorting is one of the more simple sorting algorithms out there. It generally is one of the slowest algorithms out there, going through the data it is sorting repeatedly, swapping elements as it goes until no more swaps are needed, which indicates that the data is (finally) sorted.

Why would you even want to use bubble sort? Excellent question.
